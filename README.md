ðŸš€ Project: Custom Java Firewall ðŸ”’
A custom firewall using Java, designed to enhance network security by blocking or allowing traffic based on specified IP addresses or domain names. 
Key Features:
IP & Domain Blocking: Seamlessly block or unblock specific IP addresses and domains directly through an intuitive Java-based interface.
Hosts File Management: The firewall modifies the systemâ€™s hosts file to effectively reroute traffic, preventing access to blocked sites.
Automatic DNS Cache Flush: Ensures that changes are applied instantly by automatically flushing the DNS cache after modifications.
Persistent Blocking: Implemented file handling to store and reload blocked entries across sessions, ensuring consistent protection.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed a console-based interface that provides clear feedback and error handling, making it easy to manage blocked entries.
Skills & Technologies:
Java: Advanced programming for network security applications.
Networking & Security: Practical understanding of IP addressing, domain name systems, and system-level configurations.
File Handling: Manipulating critical system files with appropriate permissions for security-related tasks.
Error Handling & Debugging: Implementing robust solutions to manage deprecated APIs and ensure smooth operation across different environments.
